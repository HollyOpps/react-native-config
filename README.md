# Config variables for React Native apps

Module to expose config variables to your javascript code in React Native, supporting both iOS and Android.

Bring some [12 factor](http://12factor.net/config) love to your mobile apps!


## IMPORTANT

this repo just folk from **[react-native-config](https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config)** fix somebugs. an new libaray **[react-native-env](https://github.com/heyholly/react-native-env)** is on the way!!

## Basic Usage

Create a new file `.env` in the root of your React Native app:

```
API_URL=https://myapi.com
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=abcdefgh
```

Then access variables defined there from your app:

```js
import Config from "react-native-config";

Config.API_URL; // 'https://myapi.com'
Config.GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY; // 'abcdefgh'
```

Keep in mind this module doesn't obfuscate or encrypt secrets for packaging, so **do not store sensitive keys in `.env`**. It's [basically impossible to prevent users from reverse engineering mobile app secrets](https://rammic.github.io/2015/07/28/hiding-secrets-in-android-apps/), so design your app (and APIs) with that in mind.
